LF.27a.391.1	LF_27a	: 40 , Because between each is 20 and if you times 20 twice you will get 40 . 	correct
LF.27a.393.1	LF_27a	: 40 , C is next to B so you add 20 meters to the elevation contour line band A . 	correct
LF.27a.400.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , The contour interval is 20 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.404.1	LF_27a	: 225 , You keep adding 75 . 	contradictory
LF.27a.405.1	LF_27a	: Because it is the its spread apart . 	irrelevant
LF.27a.408.1	LF_27a	: 60 meters , Because it said the change in elevation from line A to B is 20 meters so that lets me know to count by 20 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.421.1	LF_27a	: 40 , Because it is 20 thought A to B and B to C . 	correct
LF.27a.427.1	LF_27a	: 283 meters , Because A is higher . 	contradictory
LF.27a.436.1	LF_27a	: 45 , Because you can tell by the lines . 	contradictory
LF.27a.437.1	LF_27a	: 25 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.444.1	LF_27a	: 30 meters , I measured with my fingers that C was half of B , and since B is 20 and half of that is 10 I added both of them together and got 30 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.446.1	LF_27a	: 360 , big the line of the A , B , C , D . 	contradictory
LF.27a.452.1	LF_27a	: C , Because it said the change in elevation for A and B was 20 meters and since it 20 they might be counting by 20 's so that is my answer . 	partially_correct_incomplete
LF.27a.462.1	LF_27a	: 40 , because if it is like then to get to C just add another 20 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.468.1	LF_27a	: 30 , well because if A and B equals 20 meters and B true C looked like 10 more meters and I think is 30 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.471.1	LF_27a	: 30 , I know because A and B is 20 meters and B to C is about 10 meters and it is almost close together . 	contradictory
LF.27a.481.1	LF_27a	: 30 , because if you could change A on B so you A and C . 	contradictory
LF.27a.487.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , now I know is if A to B is 20 meters than A to C is 40 because you add another . 	correct
LF.27a.492.1	LF_27a	: A , they are closer to each other . 	irrelevant
LF.27a.497.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , Because the contour numbers or lines are counting by 20 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.499.1	LF_27a	: 60 meters , you are just doubling it . 	contradictory
LF.27a.501.1	LF_27a	: 60 meters , I labeled them . I also knew C is the third letter in the alphabet so I counted by 20 3 times . 	contradictory
LF.27a.507.1	LF_27a	: 30 meters , Because if you look at A and then C. C get a lower amount by subtracting . 	contradictory
LF.27a.510.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know this because A to B is 20 meters and the next contour line is another 20 meters away it must be 40 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.512.1	LF_27a	: Feet , because it has a great space between . 	irrelevant
LF.27a.517.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know this because the contour interval is 20 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.664.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , each line goes up 20 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.668.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , It is counting by 20 's , 0 , 20 , 40 , 60 . 	correct
LF.27a.676.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , It is on an accurate scale . 	partially_correct_incomplete
LF.27a.850.1	LF_27a	: 30 , I halved what A and B was . 	contradictory
LF.27a.855.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know this because contour intervals do not change and 20 plus 20 equals 40 . 	correct
LF.27a.856.1	LF_27a	: 50 meters , It is double the length of B plus 10 meters . 	contradictory
LF.27a.873.1	LF_27a	: 23 meters , I know because all you do is draw a line to line C . 	contradictory
LF.27a.906.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know because the distance between contour lines do not change . 	correct
LF.27a.922.1	LF_27a	: 40 , I know because the distance between every line is 20 , since 20 plus 20 equals 40 . 	correct
LF.27a.937.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know because the contour line is 20 . So since A and B is 20 add 20 more . 	correct
LF.27a.407.1	LF_27a	: Because the circle is gets bigger . 	irrelevant
LF.27a.414.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , I know because each contour line is 20 meters . 	correct
LF.27a.461.1	LF_27a	: B , Because it is between the A and C . 	irrelevant
LF.27a.682.1	LF_27a	: 40 meters , The contour elevation goes up by 20 meters and if you double 20 you get 40 . 	correct
