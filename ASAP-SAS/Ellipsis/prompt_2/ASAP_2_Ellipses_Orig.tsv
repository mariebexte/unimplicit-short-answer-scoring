3862	2	: a ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B , and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b ) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics . It also could have measured all dimensions length , width , heights of the plastic types rather than just the length . 	2	3
3163	2	: A ) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock ) ^p B ) Taken thickness temp in room , original length , etc . 	2	2
3130	2	: a . Plastic B was the most stretchy . It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter . The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials . ^p b . The students could have improved the experimental design ! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2 . They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights . 	2	2
2869	2	: The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did , Add , subtracting , multiply , divide or something . 	0	0
3100	2	: One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials . 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control ( no weight ) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample , just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start . 	2	1
4043	2	: A ) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid . This student only had two trials instead of three . ^p B ) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant . 	2	2
3635	2	: Based on the student 's data , I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial . Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic , and he should have tested each piece three times not just two . 	2	2
3007	2	: The conclusion that can be drawn , based on their data , is that that plastic type A was the least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable . One way they could 've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic . Another improvement could be that they could 've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length . 	3	3
3466	2	: A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable , or stretchs the most . Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first . and which held out the longest could have been the strongest . 	1	1
3511	2	: According to the students data the conclusion that plastic . Type A stretched the most . The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length . Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial ( T3 ) , every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail ( T3 ) in order to get the correct results . 	2	2
3149	2	: a ) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest . ^P b ) -1 ) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were . ^P 2 ) They could 've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes . 	2	2
3564	2	: Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least . The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results . 	1	1
3307	2	: a.Based on the students ' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest . It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics , and not just bathe them A , B , C , and D. This would make the experiment more accurate . 	2	1
3624	2	: a ) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability . For both trials preformed , type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm . Therefore , this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the 4 because it was able to withstand such stretching . ^p b ) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A , B , C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths . 	3	2
3259	2	: One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time . Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data . ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and , increasing its size . 	0	0
2899	2	: A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm , then on the second trial A stretched 23mm . On the other hand plastic A , C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times . 	1	1
3907	2	: Based on student data , I noticed that the trial two ( T2 ) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one ( T1 ) . I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer . I believe some plastics could have stretched more . Also , I think that in their procedure , they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference . 	1	1
3214	2	: I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break . ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out . 	0	0
3378	2	: ( A ) Based on the data , plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested . This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial , and 12 on the second , while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm , plastic C 14 and 13 , and plastic D 20 each time . This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best , and also that plastic B tolerated it the least . ^p ( B ) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data , and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible . 	2	2
3745	2	: From the student , I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ) . The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it . They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch , as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics . 	1	1
2944	2	: My conclusion is that plastic type A has the least stretchability and plastic type B has the most stretchability compared to both trials . One way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic . 	1	1
3203	2	: `` A ) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least . ^p B ) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say `` '' weights '' '' by adding how heavy the weights are . '' 	3	3
3928	2	: The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial , B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial , it stretched 23mm , However , A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm and on the second trial . it stretched 12mm without breaking . The students could have improved their exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used , they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic , and they should do more trials . 	2	2
2817	2	: A : Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm . C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between . ^p B . One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything . What plastic , how long are they etc . They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two . 	3	3
3672	2	: A ) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility . B ) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places . Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid . 	2	3
3695	2	: 3 . For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used . Also they could made the data table a little more details . ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics , also they could of put the size of the weights . 	1	1
4053	2	: a ) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two . Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials . ^p b ) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic , and how much each weight weighed . They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched . 	3	3
3940	2	: a ) With the given data , plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm . None of the other plastic types stretched as much , Plastic D one the closest at 20mm . b ) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created , which has the length of each sample at a constant length . Also , he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute , not every 5 minutes . 	2	2
3587	2	: Trial D has better performed better . 	0	0
2985	2	: The student 's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable . Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true . 	2	2
2984	2	: A : Based on the student 's data , plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable . ^p B : One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid . Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way . 	3	3
2804	2	: A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most , plastic type D stretches the second most , plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most . The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials . Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment . 	2	2
3750	2	: Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial . The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic . 	0	0
3076	2	: a . Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability , plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A . ^p b . The student could have included how much the weights weighed . This would make the experiment valid when reproduced . ^p Also , they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched . 	3	3
3854	2	: A ) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials . ^p B ) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results . 	1	1
3880	2	: From this experiment , I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least . ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one . They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic . 	3	2
3787	2	: A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials . One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length . This could help determine which plastic 's better . Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp . If one plastic has more weights than the another , it will make this experiment not valid . 	2	2
3499	2	: My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers , plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy . My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types . The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with . 	3	3
3994	2	: A ) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability . Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag . ^p B ) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic . 	1	1
3725	2	: a ) Since there were four different types of plastics , type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b ) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp , the weights , and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights . 	2	2
3999	2	: a ) In Conclusion , plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability : due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm . The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A . The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b ) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be , by adding a certain ammount of weight . And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control . 	2	2
3769	2	: Based on the student 's results , polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two . ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight , and by performing an additional trial . 	3	3
2813	2	: In conclusion , based on the students data collected , plastic type B was the farthest stretched . One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used . Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics . 	1	0
3938	2	: A ) Based on the data shown in the table . One strongest type of was plastic B . But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch . ^p B ) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add . Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment . 	1	1
2902	2	: A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both . Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted . 	2	2
2846	2	: a . ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability . The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A . b . ) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials . Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break . 	2	2
3590	2	: Plastic type B stretches the farthest . The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp . 	3	3
3029	2	: The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial . 	1	2
3718	2	: Based on the student 's data , we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability . The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less . 	2	2
3872	2	: `` In conclusion , plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types . It stretched the most . Plastic type A was the weakest . ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing `` '' record your data '' '' in the procedure after each trial . Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way . '' 	0	0
3795	2	: a . Plastic type B has the most stretching ability . As well as plastic A having the least . ^p b . 1 . They could have specified which plastics they used , not just A , B , c & d. 2 . They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps . 	2	2
2843	2	: a ) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched ( mm ) . ^p b ) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials . 	0	0
3366	2	: `` Well the `` '' T2 '' '' was higher except for `` '' C '' '' ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again . '' 	0	0
3435	2	: Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes . Plastic type A stretched the least . The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed . They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using . 	3	2
3017	2	: Based on the students data ; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched , while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched . ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are , one ; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes . Two ; They could have had more than 2 trials . 	3	3
3841	2	: In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time . Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic . 	1	1
2816	2	: I conclude , based on the data , that out of the four different polymer plastics , plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm , 23mm . Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm ; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm . 	1	1
4031	2	: In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher . In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm , plastic B increased by 1mm , plastic C increased by 1mm , and plastic D stayed the same . I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic . 	0	0
3042	2	: The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is ( 1 ) . I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2 . 	0	0
3717	2	: A ) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials . ^p B ) 1.They could of easily measured for more time . This way they could see how much more it could stretch . 2 . They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials . This way average will be more precise . 	1	2
3616	2	: A ) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B ) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched . 	0	0
3456	2	: Type plastic B stretched the longest in ( t1 ) to ( T2 ) having measurements of 22 to 23 . Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are . 	3	3
3640	2	: My conclusion would be that plastic type ( D ) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing . Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took to stretch . 	1	1
2849	2	: a . Based on the student 's result , it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes . Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average . ^p b . 1 . The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights . 2 . The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results . 	3	3
2834	2	: The students conclusion of this trial would be , plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm . Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm . type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm . And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2 . That 's what a students conclusion would look like . 	0	0
3386	2	: A . Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most . From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12 . ^p B : One way the students could ad improved they 're experiment is by doing more track . Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags . 	1	1
4055	2	: A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability . A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials , and specifying how much weight should be added . These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design . 	3	3
3952	2	: The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least . Two way 's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width . 	1	1
2942	2	: polymer A is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic D is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer . They could improve on the design . By may be using , more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions . They would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid . 	1	1
4032	2	: a ) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials . Plastic type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second . ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable . 	2	3
3436	2	: Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results is they could be more specific and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table . To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic . 	0	0
3430	2	: A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break . Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics , and tell us how long the plastic samples should be . 	3	3
3400	2	: Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic . It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics . ^p The student could have specified what weight to use , so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight . Different weights would affect accuracy negatively . The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested . For example , if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly . The student could make sure each test was in same environment . 	2	2
3322	2	: a . ) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same . The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials . ^p b . ) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on . 	1	2
3011	2	: Plastic type A was the strongest . The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2 . They also could have named the different type of plastics . 	0	0
2958	2	: Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested . Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics . One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2 . Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure . 	1	1
2934	2	: Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics . One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test . Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests . 	2	1
3401	2	: B ) One thing they could 've improved on would be the description on the steps , explain it more with detail . Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control . ^p A ) Polymer Investigation . 	0	0
3008	2	: A . In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10 , C 14 , D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12 , C,13 , D 20 . ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials . The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape , how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it 's the whole thing or just the part hanging . 	3	3
2924	2	: Based on the students data , I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it . 	3	2
3736	2	: A and C did not stretch too far , but B and D stretched much more . The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data , or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch . 	1	1
3151	2	: `` I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type `` '' A '' '' is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types . Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used . '' 	2	1
3229	2	: In the second trial , plastic A the stretch increased by two bara , Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm : almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same . Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity , one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice . Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic . 	1	1
2823	2	: ( A ) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability . ^P ( B ) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic . Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights . 	2	2
3228	2	: From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data , I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others . The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm , and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times . Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm . In conclusion , plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b ) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data . Also , running a third trial will improve their results . 	1	1
3916	2	: a ) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least . ^p B ) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure . The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes . 	2	2
3882	2	: a . ) The student 's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy . Type C is almost the same firmness as A , and D has almost the same stretch as B . ^p b ) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used , to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type . They could have repeated the experiment more , to validate their results . 	3	3
3873	2	: A conclusion I 've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased . I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most . Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights . 	2	2
2801	2	: a ) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible , stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first . b ) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways . First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results . Second , the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add . 	3	3
3976	2	: As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D , the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm . ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same . 	2	2
2936	2	: a ) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials . It 's the stretchiest . ^p b ) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it . They could of repeated the procedure one more time . They should of had a control grap . 	2	2
2862	2	: a ) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least ( with the average 11mm ) .^p b ) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic . They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result . 	2	2
3331	2	: In conclution , plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same . ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics . Their data could have been put clearer also . 	0	0
3293	2	: The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most , because it was the longest length after being stretched . The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials , to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from . The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start , and the results would be more accurate . 	3	3
3242	2	: a ) After evaluating the student 's data , it appears that plastic type A stretches the least ( 10mm- 12mm ) and plastic type B stretches the most ( 22mm-23mm ) . Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b ) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags . Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials , using a different length of time each trial . 	2	3
3413	2	: a ) Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability , it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials , while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm . ^p ( b ) The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights . 	3	3
2971	2	: a ) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1 . ^p b ) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others . 	1	1
3933	2	: a ) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm , plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same . B ) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details . I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different . 	0	0
3383	2	: The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different . The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment . 	1	2
2925	2	: a . ) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested . ^p b . ) The students can able more trials to their experiments . Also , they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used . 	2	2
